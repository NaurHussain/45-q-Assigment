// 17. Shrinking Guest List:  
// You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have 
// space for only two guests. 
// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can 
// invite only two people for dinner. 
// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you 
// pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t 
// invite them to dinner. 
// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited. 
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you 
// actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
